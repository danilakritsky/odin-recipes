    <p>
      This classic lemonade recipe is the one my mom used to make for me when I was little.
      Ah, the taste of summer! It's the perfect combination of sweet and tart. When using a clear pitcher,
      adding a few of the juiced lemon halves makes it look prettier.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>6 lemons</li>
        <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>6 cups water, or more as needed</li>
      </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol start="1">
        <li>Juice lemons, you should have 1 cup juice.</li>
        <li>
            Combine juice, sugar, and water in a 1/2-gallon pitcher. Stir until sugar dissolves.
            Taste and add more water if desired.
        </li>
        <li>Chill and serve over ice.</li>
      </ol>
